Handling Overflow:
==================
content overflow can be handled using the CSS overflow property.
---------------------
1) visible (default)=> CSS tries to avoid data loss. Hence, the overflow:visible; is the default value for it.
2) hidden => The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
3) scroll => The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content.
4) auto => It is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary.
